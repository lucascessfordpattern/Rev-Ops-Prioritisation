| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Goutham & Chris | Build category explorer global view | in progress | 7 days | Goutham & Chris have requested that Category Insights data be made available to global audience. US customers have more data so they have an enriched version, but for global customers, no service was yet available |
| Joe W | n8n Outreach Automation | in progress  | 5 days | Joe has requested an automation to be build which will allow him to have AI draft data enriched emails from kitchen. He will be able to list out the brands he wants to generate outreach emails for. AI will draft up the emails with tone being set based off of an engineered prompt. |
| Collin G | Ads Analysis Improvements | queued | - | Collin is spending considerable time (sometimes up to 3 or 4 hours a day) running Ads analysis manually. Sales-Kitchen could be used to improve the speed, making the analysis immediate for his use case | 
| Max | Add US to grandpar | queued | 5 days | After the success of the European PAR automation, Max would like it extended to cover the US use case. This can be migrated to N8N for improved usability |
| Finn | Automated Deck generation | queued| 12 days | Finn spends alot of time generating slides for stakeholders, which ends up being manual and slow. Automated deck creation from Sales-Kitchen visuals would speed up his productivity dramatically |
