## ⚙️ Open Tasks 

**Tasks are in order of priority** - Should you feel that your task needs prioritising, please reach out to Charlie Bevis for escalation and I will be happy to prioritise accordingly.

| --- | ---| --- | --- | ---|
| Collin G | Ads Analysis Improvements | In Progress | 20 days | Collin is spending considerable time (sometimes up to 3 or 4 hours a day) running Ads analysis manually. Sales-Kitchen could be used to improve the speed, making the analysis immediate for his use case | 
| Andrew H | Ops Analysis | Queued | 10 days | Brands have requested ops analysis so a page will be built in Kitchen | 
| Finn | Automated Deck generation | Queued| 5 days | Finn spends alot of time generating slides for stakeholders, which ends up being manual and slow. Automated deck creation from Sales-Kitchen visuals would speed up his productivity dramatically |

## 📋 Current Instruction on Prioritisation

This is the instruction that has been provided on how to prioritise requests.
Feel free to use these instructions to support a case in escalation.

 - Tasks that generate revenue over tasks that save time will be prioritised
 - Tasks that save more time than other tasks will be prioritised
 - With the release of N8N within the organisation, tasks that could be automated without support will be deprioritised
