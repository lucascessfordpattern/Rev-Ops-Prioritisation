## ‚öôÔ∏è Open Tasks 

**Tasks are in order of priority** - Should you feel that your task needs prioritising, please reach out to Charlie Bevis for escalation and I will be happy to prioritise accordingly.

| Requestor | Request | Status | Time Est. | Description |
| --- | ---| --- | --- | ---|
| Joe W | N8N Outreach Automation | Hypercare  | 5 days | Joe has requested an automation to be build which will allow him to have AI draft data enriched emails from kitchen. He will be able to list out the brands he wants to generate outreach emails for. AI will draft up the emails with tone being set based off of an engineered prompt. |
| Collin G | Ads Analysis Improvements | queued | - | Collin is spending considerable time (sometimes up to 3 or 4 hours a day) running Ads analysis manually. Sales-Kitchen could be used to improve the speed, making the analysis immediate for his use case | 
| Max | Add US to Grandpar | queued | 5 days | After the success of the European PAR automation, Max would like it extended to cover the US use case. This can be migrated to N8N for improved usability |
| Finn | Automated Deck generation | queued| 12 days | Finn spends alot of time generating slides for stakeholders, which ends up being manual and slow. Automated deck creation from Sales-Kitchen visuals would speed up his productivity dramatically |

| Lily Z | Create Contacts Lead Report | queued | 1 day | list of all contacts with an EMEA score above 210. This should a new tab called MQL in lily's report |

## üìã Current Instruction on Prioritisation

This is the instruction that has been provided on how to prioritise requests.
Feel free to use these instructions to support a case in escalation.

 - Tasks that generate revenue over tasks that save time will be prioritised
 - Tasks that save more time than other tasks will be prioritised
 - With the release of N8N within the organisation, tasks that could be automated without support will be deprioritised
